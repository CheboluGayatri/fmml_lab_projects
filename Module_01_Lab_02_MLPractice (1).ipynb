The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated . If the learning rate is too large, it may result in unstable training and learning a sub-optimal set of weights too fast or an unstable training process . On the other hand, if the learning rate is too small, it may result in a long training process that could get stuck . Therefore, choosing an appropriate learning rate is crucial for training a neural network."
